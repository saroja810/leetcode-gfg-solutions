## Easy
A cafe has n computers. The customer events are represented by a string s of uppercase English letters, where each distinct letter appears exactly twice:

The first occurrence denotes the customer's arrival.
The second occurrence denotes the customer's departure.

A customer is assigned a computer only if one is available at the time of arrival, otherwise the customer is rejected and does not use a computer.
Return the number of customers who could not be assigned a computer upon arrival.
